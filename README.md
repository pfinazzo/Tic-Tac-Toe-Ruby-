Ruby Tic Tac Toe!

To run this code you need to clone and download this directory, then open up terminal and cd into the directory new_ruby_tic_tac_toe wherever you decided to place it. Then the command is ($ ruby rrr.rb) to run the ruby code in the terminal.

To place a move simply type the grid pair (i.e. a1, b2, c1, b3, etc). When a match or tie game occurs the game will restart.


I am planning on adding a score counter as well to keep track of score. I am also currently working on making each player switch between who puts the first move in game down.
